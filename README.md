# Honeycomb Bravo Only
## 1. Initial Installation
### 1.1 Binding Layer Switch Keys
In your xplane's joystick configuration, bind layer up/down btn to anything you like. I used trim wheel and trim B (on alpha)

### 1.2 Binding Bravo Keys
Similar to above, you need to bind key 20-33 to these

Note:
20 & 21: Button 1
22 & 22: Button 2
....
32 && 33: Button 7

## 2. Add Layers and Btn mapping
There is a csv file for zibo 737 provided as an example:

you can define as many layers as you want and each layer can have up to 7 btns. The command is what xplane will do when you click on that btn when you are on that layer.
